Going through tutorials from [Go By Example](https://github.com/mmcgrana/gobyexample) and [Golang Examples](https://github.com/SimonWaldherr/golang-examples) to get familiar with programming in [Go](http://golang.org).

Each tutorial set will be gone through twice, first pass will be for the foundation and understanding and the second pass through will extend upon the tutorials with more advanced techniques.
